When I heard that the new iPhone had come out, I immediately went to Apple's website to learn more about it. I'm willing to bet that, like me, most of you use the internet to research product and service information before making a purchase online or at the store. This demonstrates the importance of an effective website for today's businesses.

So what makes an effective website? We can use <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple's</a> website as an example to answer that question. Apple's homepage has a clean and simple layout. It has an easy to navigate menu at the top, highlights products as the user scrolls down, and includes a footer for other services at the bottom. The page is visually attractive as well as informative, encouraging users to buy their products.
