summary: My group produced an Ilokano film that was shown at the Timpuyog Drama and Song Festival.
---
Our film was put together by the students of UH Manoa's Ilokano program with the aim of promoting the Ilokano language and culture. We were tasked with creating a film with the theme "Superheroes." Our film was inspired by the show Captain Planet. We worked collaboratively to write a script, scout locations and gather materials. We appointed roles for directors, actors, film and editing crew based on our strengths. Because of this project, I got to try new things such as acting and doing voiceovers. I also met other people who are driven by the same cause and together, we created something that we are all very proud of.
