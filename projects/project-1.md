summary: My group produced an Ilokano film that was shown at the Timpuyog Drama and Song Festival.
---
Our film was put together by the students of UH Manoa's Ilokano program with the aim of promoting the Ilokano language and culture. We were tasked with creating a film in the Ilokano language with the theme "Superheroes." Our film was inspired by the show Captain Planet and the need to relay the importance of preserving one's culture. We worked collaboratively to write a script, scout locations and gather materials. We appointed roles for directors, actors, film and editing crew based on our strengths. The film became more than just a class project for a grade. Because of this project, I got to try new things such as acting and doing voiceovers. I also met other people who are driven by the same cause and together, we created something that we are all very proud of.
